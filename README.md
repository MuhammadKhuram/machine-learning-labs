# machine-learning-labs
Machine Learning course labs covering perceptrons, SVM, PCA, clustering, and reinforcement learning algorithms.

---

This repository contains the practical lab implementations from my **Machine Learning course**.  
Each lab folder includes the source code and the main code.  

The labs cover a wide range of **machine learning algorithms and concepts**, from classical models like perceptrons and SVMs to reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-Learning and SARSA.
